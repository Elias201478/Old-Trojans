# is this a joke? 🤔

nope. is not a joke. be very very Careful what your doing.
Use only a vm.

# then how do i fix this computer?

follow these steps if you want to restore your pc.

 # Step 1: Power Check🔌
Make sure the wall outlet works (test with another device).

Try a different power cable.

If you have a spare PSU (power supply), swap it in — dead PSUs are the most common “PC won’t turn on” culprit.

# Step 2: Minimal Boot🧩
Disconnect everything except:

Motherboard

CPU

One stick of RAM

PSU

Try to power on.

If fans spin or lights blink, the board is alive.

If nothing happens, suspect PSU or motherboard.

# Step 3: Isolate Components💾
RAM: Test one stick at a time in different slots.

GPU: Remove it and use integrated graphics (if your CPU supports it).

Storage drives: Disconnect them — a bad drive can sometimes block boot.

# Step 4: Visual Inspection🔍
Look for burn marks, swollen capacitors, or cracked chips on the motherboard.

If you see physical damage, repair isn’t realistic — replacement is needed.

# Step 5: Salvage Data📀
Even if the PC is dead, the hard drive/SSD may still work.

Use a USB‑to‑SATA adapter or plug the drive into another PC to recover files.

# Step 6: Decision Point🛠️
If motherboard or CPU is fried → You’ll need to rebuild with new parts.

If only PSU or RAM is bad → Replace those and the PC may live again.

If multiple parts are gone → Salvage what you can (case, drives, fans) and rebuild.

And now your all done.
